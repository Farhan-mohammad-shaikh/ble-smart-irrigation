# IoT-Based Smart Irrigation Controller with BLE and Blynk

This project implements an IoT-enabled irrigation system using the nRF52832 microcontroller and BLE technology. It integrates soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors to optimize garden watering schedules. The system communicates with the Blynk app for local monitoring and control over BLE, allowing for efficient water usage and plant health management.

## Project Overview

This smart irrigation controller is designed to automate garden watering by monitoring soil conditions and environmental parameters. The system uses the Blynk app for a user-friendly interface, enabling real-time monitoring and manual control. The water pump is automatically activated based on the soil moisture level, helping to prevent overwatering or underwatering.

### Key Features
- **Microcontroller**: nRF52832 SoC with BLE support.
- **Sensors Used**:
  - **Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor**: Measures soil moisture content to determine watering needs.
  - **DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**: Measures environmental temperature and humidity.
- **Actuator**: Water pump controlled via a relay module.
- **Communication**: BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) using Blynk for local monitoring and control.
- **Control and Monitoring**: Blynk app displays real-time sensor data and allows manual control of the water pump.
